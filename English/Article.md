Articles are words used **before nouns** to define their definiteness (specific or general). There are **three articles** in English:

1. **Definite Article: "The"**
	- Used for **specific** nouns (both singular and plural).
	- The listener/reader knows _exactly_ which thing you’re talking about.

    - **Example**:
        - _"The dog barked."_ (We know which dog.)
        - _"The apples are sweet."_ (Specific apples.)

     ==when we mention something for the 2nd time==
		   - "I saw a seagull eating a hamburger in the middle of the street."
		   - " **The** seagull finished **the** hamburger in about two mintues. "

2. **Indefinite Articles: "A" and "An"**
    - Used for **general, non-specific** nouns (singular only).
    - **"A"** → Before consonant sounds (_a cat, a university_).
    - **"An"** → Before vowel sounds (_an apple, an hour_).

    - **Example**:
        - _"I saw a bird."_ (Any bird, not specific.)
        - _"She is an engineer."_ (General profession.)

3. **Zero Article (No Article)**
    - Used for **plural nouns** or **uncountable nouns** when speaking generally.

    - **Example**:
        - _"Cats are cute."_ (All cats in general.)
        - _"Love is beautiful."_ (Uncountable, no article.)

### **Rules & Common Mistakes**

✔ **Use "the" for unique things**:
- _The sun, the moon, the Internet._

❌ **No article for general activities**:
- _"I love playing football."_ (Not _"the football"_.)

✔ **"A" vs. "An" depends on sound, not spelling**:
- _A university_ (sounds like "yoo-ni-ver-si-ty").
- _An hour_ (silent "h").

❌ **Don’t use articles before proper nouns (usually)**:
- _"I visited Paris."_ (Not _"the Paris"_.)
